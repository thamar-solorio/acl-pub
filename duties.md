## What is my goal?
The final goal is to produce beautiful proceedings to be hosted on the [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/)! 

## People pub-chairs regularly interface with: 
* Pricilla Rasmussen, Local Arrangements Chair. Gives us the ISBN numbers
* ACL Anthology editor, previously Min-Yen Kan. Give us the bibtex urls and support for uploading to the anthology
* Handbook Chair: their duties typically start just after the camera-ready time, and are primarily concerned with `order` files. You'll need to make sure that any changes the handbook chair requests are also reflected in the pdf proceedings. 
* START/SoftConf support (support@softconf.com). Email them with any START-related issues. They are usually very quick to respond!

## Some duties and timeline of pub chairs

There are several critcal times for pub-chairs. I will include the NAACL 2019 timeline as an example, with pub chair actionable items in **bold**.

|Date  | Item |
|---|---|
 | **August 2018** | Update NAACL style templates for CFP |
 | December 3 | Abstracts and keywords due |
 | December 10 | Final paper submissions |
 | **December 11** | Workshops are determined. Create a master spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hSlqWCcTHZw-vaUQz-CBULIWtO99e0mNI8QP9sDohT0/edit#gid=0) |
 | **January 2019** | Email all book chairs. Ask them to fill in their softconf abbreviation in the spreadsheet and confirm the title and email alias. Also send [001.overview.md](001.overview.md) and [002.book.md](002.book.md) instructions to prepare them |
 | February 22 | Notification of acceptance (long, short, & industry track) |
 | **March 1** | Send email to all book chairs. Ask them to start to fill in softconf information in Step 4 and 6 following the [002.book.md](002.book.md) guide. |
 | March 18 | Notification of acceptance (demos) |
 | March 27 | Notification of acceptance (workshops) |
 | **March 28** | Send email to all book chairs. Ask them to continue to fill in softconf information, following the remainder of the [002.book.md](002.book.md) guide |
 | April 1 | Camera ready papers due (long, short, & industry track) |
 | April 5 | Camera-ready papers due (workshops) |
 | **April 10** | Pub chairs finish checking papers for formatting and have sent out author requests for corrections. Pub chairs are also working on the web anthology information for main papers, and checking over the work the Book chairs have done during this time. |
 | **April 24** | Close camera ready submission (we need to make sure that authors know this date up front when the revisions begin, and that the start portals have all been closed at this time) |
 | **May 5** | Pub chairs can try to wrap up everything and pass the torch to the handbook chair, who will pull from the web anthology information |
 | **May 22** | Send proceedings to anthology editor, and have some time to make adjustments with editor if necessary. |
 | June 2 - 7| NAACL conference |

### Early stages, prior to CFP

* Update latex and word templates. Make sure that NAACL and ACL are using the same template 
* Create an overleaf template
  * Click 'Journals/Services' > 'Submit to Overleaf Gallery'

### Once workshops are determined

* Create a mailing list for book chairs for easier communication in later stages. Include: 
  * conference pub-chair alias 
  * all of the workshop chairs aliases
  * workshop organizers alias
  * SRW organizers alias
  * WiNLP alias (though they are typically not archival)
  * industry chairs alias (if applicable)
  * demo chairs alias
  * tuotrial chairs alias (though typically, the pub-chairs have done everything detailed in [002.book](002.book.md) for the tutorials)
* Create a google doc or shared spreadsheet (e.g., [from NAACL 2019](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hSlqWCcTHZw-vaUQz-CBULIWtO99e0mNI8QP9sDohT0/edit?usp=sharing), [from NAACL 2018](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBaP9ddI-5XGDvDvB0xSxgaLgz438P5MlGNVKtQZS8w/edit?usp=sharing)) and populate with the following for the main proceedings, workshops, SRW, demos, tutorials:
  * SoftConf abbreviation
  * Title (this must be correct for getting the ISBN)
  * SIG: is this workshop to appear as a SIG on the anthology? the workshop organizers should know this
  * ISBN: a blank column to be filled in later by Pricilla
  * Url Prefix for Proceedings: i.e., Bibtex url. A blank colunm to be filled in later by Min-Yen
  * Url: workshop homepages
  * SoftConf url: for easy access
  * Optional columns for indicating if the proceedings have been finalized

### Around Submission Deadline

* Authors may email pub-chairs about formatting issues (especially with people using the Word template) or extensions (extensions are not handled by us-- direct them to the PCs). 
* Send an email around this time, and 1.5-2 months before camera ready to the Book Chairs pointing them to the following, in order to prepare for what's next
  * [001.overview.md](001.overview.md)
  * [002.book.md](002.book.md)
  * [Camera Ready FAQ](camera-ready-faq.md) for them to send to the authors
* Instruct book chairs to make a first attempt at an order file in START. This experience will be helpful later on.

### Around Author Notification Time & Prior to Camera Ready Deadline

* Optionally update the [Camera Ready FAQ](camera-ready-faq.md). 
* Ask the PCs to point authors to the [Camera Ready FAQ](camera-ready-faq.md) guide (either in the email notification or on a blog)
* Make sure Rich (Softconf) initializes the camera-ready interface from the NAACL main one.
* Optionally update the camera-ready submission form.
* Request access to all the Softconf/START portals associated with the conference. We need access to all of them. 

### After Author Notification

We do these for main conference proceedings. The other Book Chairs are left to do it for their own workshops, demos, etc, but we verify all of theirs as well 
* Begin to complete the START proceedings for long and short papers following [002.book.md](002.book.md). This includes:
  * CDROM tab (with bibtex url)
  * Citation stamp
  * ISBN
  * Order files
* Notify Book chairs that they should be doing the same

### After Camera Ready Deadline

* Manually inspect the camera ready long and short papers, and continue to follow [002.book.md](002.book.md). Important things we look for are: 
  * Make sure the papers have followed the style guidelines
  * Make sure the papers fit within the proceedings margins
  * Make sure figures don't depend on color to convey information

* Once the final papers are submitted, Pub Chairs additionally must
  * Validate and correct paper metadata,  e.g., author name formatting is takien from their START account information
  * Make sure all copyright and video release forms have been signed and entered
  * Make sure the list of paper authors (this is only for the most thorough pub chairs!) 
* If you find errors, you must email the authors. With the PC's and Handbook chair, determine an appropriate window to allow for revisions (~2 weeks. Making sure you have a hard cut off date will make your life easier! Make sure the START portal is officially closed after this deadline). 

* Pub Chais must finalize the main conference proceedings from [002.book.md](002.book.md).

* Ensure all Book Chairs have followed [002.book.md](002.book.md) as well, including the tasks listed above for pub chairs.
  * Flip through their proceedings and make sure they have caught the paper formatting issues. If not, ask the organizers to email the paper authors ASAP.
  * In the past, it's best to split this effort between pub-chairs and verify the others' work :) 
* Work with the General Chair and Program Chairs to fill out their welcome messages in the front matter.
* Work with the Handbook Chair if they need changes to the proceedings order files

### Compiling the Proceedings

This phase begins after you have verified the main proceedings and all the other books in your conference: 
* [Build the ACL Web Anthology](full-aclweb-proceedings-howto.md), the results of which are posted on the [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/). 

### After the Conference

* Update these readmes with what you've learned, so we can make this process more efficient next year!
* If authors ask to make a correction after their paper has been posted on the Anthology, they will have to invoke the revision process [http://aclanthology.info/corrections](http://aclanthology.info/corrections). This may require you to regenerate the full proceedings pdf. 

## Gotchas
A list of some outstanding issues: 
* DOI instructions
* Hyperlinks not working after START compiles the targets
* Short and long paper separation instructions need to be added to the repository

## Authors
The material included in it has evolved over many years through the work of a large number of volunteers, including past NAACL and ACL publications chairs, including Stephanie Lukin, Matt Post.
