Responsibilities
---------------
Produce the proceedings for your workshop or conference.  
Make sure they don't have any problems and look good.

The Process
---------------

1. Authors use [the style templates below](#the-templates), to create the camera-ready papers.
   1. There's an FAQ for authors here, and feel free to add more: [camera-ready-faq.md](camera-ready-faq.md)
2. Remind authors: 
    1. The date the camera-ready is due
    2. Camera-ready long papers may include 9 pages
    3. Unlimited pages for references and appendices
    4. The margin rulers and anonymization 
       can be removed by uncommenting the <code>\aclfinalcopy</code> 
       command near the top of the .tex file.
3. Set up the Final Submission Page on your Softconf website. 
   Your Softconf website is probably something like: 
   "https://www.softconf.com/acl2018/" + [your Softconf acronym on this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBaP9ddI-5XGDvDvB0xSxgaLgz438P5MlGNVKtQZS8w/edit?usp=sharing) 
4. Remind authors again of the camera-ready due date; I prefer 
    doing it two weeks before, 
    1 week before, 3 days before, and 1 day before.
5. Authors upload camera-ready papers by logging into the submission page on START, at "https://www.softconf.com/acl2018/" + [your Softconf acronym on this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBaP9ddI-5XGDvDvB0xSxgaLgz438P5MlGNVKtQZS8w/edit?usp=sharing) + "/papers".
6. Once they've uploaded to START, now you:
    1. <a href="002.book.md">Generate proceedings within START</a>
    2. Download the proceedings to see all issues
    3. Address the issues in START
    4. Repeat steps i-iii until the proceedings are good to go.
7.  E-mail a link to your final proceedings to 
    [acl-pub-chairs](mailto:acl-pub-chairs@googlegroups.com).


This page will be regularly updated with information
for **Organizers** of co-hosted conferences and workshops.

[Email](mailto:acl-pub-chairs@googlegroups.com) the publications chairs
if you have questions about preparing your paper or proceedings.


Setting up the Final submission page to collect the Camera ready papers
---------------

Before you start collecting the camera-ready papers for your conference or workshop, you need to create a **Custom Final Submission Page**. To do that, you need to go in the _Manager Console_, then to the _Custom Submission Page Editor_ in your workshop's softconf account.

First of all, please check that a final page for your publication does not already exist. If you are running a workshop, in fact, it may be that the Softconf people already populated an ACLPUB final submission page for you.

If a final submission page is not yet available, please create one by clicking on the _New Page_ tab, using the "-- (ACLPUB Final Submission template) --". Please edit all the copyright information and the additional text as you wish. You may add additional textboxes, selectors, and the like to collect more information if needed.

When you are satisfied with the final submission page, you need to make it visible by activating it. To activate it, please go in the Manager Console, then _Visibility/Phasing/Deadlines_. Make the page the only one visible for **Revision**, and be sure to set a reasonable **deadline** for the page.

To test if the page works properly, you need to try it using the passcode of an accepted paper. To get the passcode, you can use the Spreadsheet Maker in the Manager Console.
